# What's recipe?

A code recipe is a set of instructions, written in code, that describes how to perform a specific task or achieve a particular outcome. It is a way to share and reuse code snippets that can be easily understood and implemented by other developers. A code recipe can be anything from a simple script to a more complex set of instructions that can be used to build and deploy a full application.
