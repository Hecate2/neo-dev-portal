# Overview

Here youâ€™ll find documentation to help you build with Neo. Explore these documents to learn about the Neo blockchain at a conceptual level, understand the basics of the Neo technology stack, and drill down further into advanced topics that cover more complex applications and use cases.
Neo has been an open-source community effort from the beginning. We invite you to contribute your own ideas and knowledge to help Neo continue to improve and evolve. Wherever you see a need, you are welcome to suggest new topics, add your own content, or provide examples. All documentation can be edited via [GitHub.](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-dev-portal)
